The core algorithm used to compute geodesic distances and paths comes from

(2) [Shi-Qing Xin and Guo-Jin Wang](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1559755.1559761). Improving chen and han's algorithm on the discrete geodesic problem. ACM Trans. Graph., 28(4):104:1–104:8, September 2009

This paper is itself an improvement on the  work of 

(3) Chen and Han (Shortest paths on a polyhedron. Internat. J. Comput. Geom. Appl., 6:127–144, 1996),

which itself improves on the original MMP algorithm for finding discrete geodesics:
